<h3>Hey there!</h3> ðŸ‘‹

<p>We're a group of people from around the globe, based in Canda.<br>
Our project is the Prometheus mSLA printer, a resin printer that aims to be fully open-source.</p>

<p>This consists of:
<ul>
    <li>The [CAD](https://github.com/TheContrappostoShop/Prometheus-MSLA)</li>
    <li>The [Apollo Controller Board](https://github.com/TheContrappostoShop/Apollo)</li>
    <li>The [Custom OS](https://github.com/TheContrappostoShop/PrometheusOS)</li>
    <li>The Backend, [Odyssey](https://github.com/TheContrappostoShop/Odyssey)</li>
    <li>The Frontend (WIP)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>We try to aim to stay as true to open-source as possible! As this is a WIP effort,<br>
not all Licenses might be abiding by the requirements at all times.</p>
